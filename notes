AWS Setup & Basics
- IAM user created
- AWS CLI configured
- Services overview (EC2, S3, Lambda, IAM)
- EC2 instance launched (AMI: Amazon Linux 2, t2.micro)
- SSH connection working

S3 Storage (CLI, EC2 + Role, Python SDK)
- S3 bucket created
- S3 upload/sync/download tested (CLI)
- IAM Role created and attached to EC2
- EC2 can access S3 without credentials
- Python code to upload/download files from S3 using Boto3 SDK

Lambda + API Gateway
- Create basic Lambda function to print "hello" and configure S3 as trigger.
- Any upload/download on s3 bucket will trigger Lambda function, see CloudWatch Logs
- Create basic Lambda so it can receive custom JSON data from API Gateway.

    def lambda_handler(event, context):
      print("Event received:", event)
      # Extract JSON body if it exists
      body_message = "No data received"
      if 'body' in event and event['body']:
          try:
              data = json.loads(event['body'])
              name = data.get("name", "Guest")
              body_message = f"Hello, {name}! Lambda received your data."
          except Exception as e:
              body_message = f"Error parsing JSON: {str(e)}"
    
      print(body_message)
    
      return {
          'statusCode': 200,
          'body': json.dumps({"message": body_message})
      }
"""
- Create and deploy REST API at API Gateway, create resource, method,  and integrate lambda function. (GET/POST)
- url will trigger lambda function, to view the event data use postman to send body.
